# Welcome to High Card, Low Card!
This was made by Anna Rector for CSE 210.

This game uses the Random module to generate two cards. The first card gets displayed to the player. The player then has to guess if the second card is higher or lower than the first one.

This project is a sub-folder of the main CSE 210 repository.

The required software to run this program is anything that can run Python in a terminal. The creator's reccomendation is Visual Studio Code.
